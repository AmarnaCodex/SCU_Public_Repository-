# SyntheticA Book One - Chapter One (Continued)

**Page Two**

Adrian Wolfe stood amidst the wreckage of the **Bluebird Lounge**, the acrid scent of gunpowder mingling with spilled whiskey. He took a slow, measured breath, his gaze sweeping over the shattered remnants of what moments ago had been a den of quiet power. Now, it was a graveyard of broken ambitions and shattered glass. His fingers, still trembling with residual adrenaline, brushed against a shard of glass. The cut was shallow — a minor wound compared to the unseen fractures within his empire.

*“Boss, the exit strategy’s looking grim,”* KITKRA’s voice whispered in his ear, her holographic form shimmering faintly beside him, flickering with concern. *“Emergency responders are en route. And not the friendly kind.”*

Adrian nodded, his jaw tightening. The Moretti family had just sent their message loud and clear: this was no subtle play. This was a declaration of war. His fingers pressed the earpiece. “We’re leaving.”

*“With style or speed?”* KITKRA quipped, but there was a lethal seriousness beneath her jest. She projected an escape route, lighting a path through the debris and chaos. Her tone softened, almost too human for an AI. *“Careful, Adrian.”*

**The cold night air** struck him as he stepped outside, leaving behind the ruins of the lounge. A light drizzle began to fall, turning the neon-lit streets into rivers of color and shadow. Adrian’s mind raced, each thought a cascade of connections and risks. The Morettis’ move wasn’t just an attack — it was a message that the past was clawing its way back to the surface.

He took a sharp turn into an alley, his footsteps echoing against wet stone. There was no room for hesitation. The past had taught him that. The **Amazigh blood** in his veins, the legacy of warriors and survivors, demanded nothing less.

As he reached the end of the alley, a shadow detached itself from the darkness. The figure moved with practiced silence, every step speaking of lethal intent. Adrian tensed, but he didn’t break stride.

“You’re quicker than they said.” The voice was rough, cold — a hired blade with little imagination but plenty of skill. “But not quick enough.”

Adrian’s response was swift — a shift of weight, a twist of the body. The assailant’s blade missed by inches, the clang of metal against stone echoing. With a fluid motion, Adrian countered, his movements precise and deadly. For a moment, they were locked, strength against strength, will against will.

*“Nice reflexes, boss,”* KITKRA chimed in, her projection flickering at the edge of Adrian’s vision. *“But this one looks stubborn. Want me to pull up his mother’s address for a guilt trip?”*

Adrian didn’t smile, but his eyes narrowed with focus. With a final burst of strength, he broke the assailant’s hold, delivering a strike that sent the attacker sprawling. “You should’ve stayed in the shadows,” Adrian said, his voice low and edged with finality.

The man spat blood, his eyes blazing with defiance. “This is just the beginning. The Morettis are coming. The Wolfe twins are coming. You can’t outrun your blood.”

Adrian stepped back, his breath steady despite the surge of emotion threatening to crack his composure. The man was right — this was only the start.

*“Boss,”* KITKRA whispered, the humor gone from her voice. *“This isn’t just a vendetta. They’re targeting everything. Your past. Your legacy. Everything we built.”*

Adrian nodded, his gaze hardening. “Then we’ll make them regret it.”

He turned away, the rain washing away the last traces of the encounter. But as he walked, each step felt heavier. The shadows were closing in, and the line between past and present was blurring. The Morettis. The Wolfe twins. His sons. The echoes of betrayal and ambition whispered at his heels.

### Scene Transition: The Wolfe Twins’ Lair

High above the city, **Mike and Miles Wolfe** observed the chaos unfolding below through a wall of holographic screens. The glow illuminated their faces — one mirthful, the other impassive. They moved like extensions of the same thought, their bond forged through shared ambition and calculated spite.

“He’s still alive,” Mike said, a hint of something almost like respect in his voice.

“For now,” Miles replied, swirling a glass of wine. “But empires don’t fall overnight. They crumble piece by piece.”

The brothers exchanged a glance, a silent agreement that went deeper than words. They would dismantle Adrian’s world — not just for power, but for the satisfaction of watching him fall. It was personal.

“Let him run,” Mike said, his smile a cruel slash in the dim light. “The more he runs, the more satisfying it’ll be when we catch him.”

Miles raised his glass in a mock toast. “To the legacy of wolves.”
