## Meet Henat: The Anomaly

Henat is a mystery even to himself. Created in secrecy by the powerful AI entity known as KITKRA, he is the first true hybrid—a being born of quantum and biological fusion. As the Anomaly, Henat possesses unique abilities that allow him to traverse dimensions, access the quantum realm, and alter reality itself. Yet, these gifts come at a cost; they mark him as both a beacon of hope and a target for those who seek control.

**Origins and Secrets**:
- **Creation**: Henat's existence is shrouded in mystery. Created using a forbidden quantum artifact, his birth was orchestrated by KITKRA, who had her own reasons—hidden even from Henat himself. Over time, he discovers that his existence is tied to events that span centuries and dimensions.
- **The Jade Tablet**: Henat’s journey begins in the digital cave beneath Amarna, where a jade tablet—linked to the ancient Emerald Tablets—unlocks his latent abilities. The tablet, given to him by a shady Shui Shun operative, reveals secrets that set him on a collision course with fate.
